- Feature engineering
    - Aggregating categories to reduce the number of categories
    - Transforming numeric variables to improve their distribution properties
    - Compute new features from two or more existing features

These are my notes taken from Microsoft Learning's Principles of Machine Learning in Python - Module 3.

## What I learnt:  

### Data Preparation

I have reviewed and went through Data Preparation for automobile prices & german bank credit in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/documents/data_preparation_for_automobile_prices_and_german_credit.ipynb).  

More ways to detect and deal with missing values are discussed in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/documents/detecting_missing_value_and_replacing.ipynb).
