- Data Preparation for Machine Learning
- Recode column names containing special characters
- Treat missing values
- Transform column data type
- Feature engineering
    - Aggregating categories to reduce the number of categories
    - Transforming numeric variables to improve their distribution properties
    - Compute new features from two or more existing features  
- Remove duplicates

These are my notes taken from Microsoft Learning's Principles of Machine Learning in Python - Module 3.

## What I learnt:  

### Data Preparation

**Method:** Visualize and explore data (exploratory data analysis) 
- Examine the imbalance in the label cases using a frequency table.
- Find numeric or categorical features that separate the cases using visualization.

**Goal:** To  explore a dataset about automobile pricing to determine which features may be useful in predicting the customers with bad credit. 
- for classification problems, we are looking for features that help separate the label categories.
- To understand which features are useful for class separation.

I have reviewed and went through Data Preparation for automobile prices & german bank credit in this [**link**](xxx).
