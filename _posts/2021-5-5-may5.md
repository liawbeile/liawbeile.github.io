Loops:  
1. while
2. break, continue
3. else (with break, continue)  

Strings:
1. isalpha()
2. isdigit()
3. isalnum()

## What I learnt:  

### Loops:  
**1. while** loop  
when a condition is fulfilled or if something is True  
```python
# Prints out 0,1,2,3,4
count=0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count+=1
```

**2. break, continue**
- ***break*** is used to exit a "for" or "while" loop  
```python
# Prints out 0,1,2,3,4
count = 0
while True:
    print(count)
    count += 1
    if count >= 5:
        break
```
- ***continue*** is used to skip the current block, and return to the "for" or "while" statement  
```python
# Prints out only odd numbers - 1,3,5,7,9
for x in range(10):
    # Check if x is even
    if x % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(x)
```

**3. else** in loops  
If 'break' is executed inside the for loop, the 'else' part is skipped.  
The 'else' part is executed even if there is a 'continue' statement.  
```python
# Prints out 0,1,2,3,4 and then it prints "count value reached 5"
count=0
while(count<5):
    print(count)
    count +=1
else:
    print(f"count value reached {count}")
```
```python
# Prints out 1,2,3,4
for i in range(1, 10):
    if(i%5==0):
        break
    print(i)
else:
    print("this is not printed because for loop is terminated because of break")
```

### Strings:  
**string.isalpha( ), string.isdigit( ), string.isalnum( )**  
Checks if the item is alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric  
Then, it gives True or False  
```python 
course_input = input("Please enter the course you are enrolled").upper()
if course_input.isalnum():
    print("your course input is:", course_input)
else:
    print("please input only alpha numeric")
```

## Thoughts

It's especially great to learn a new type of loop - the 'while' loop, in addition to the 'for' loop which I have been using. There are many statements in loops that can be used such as pass, break, continue, return, else ... and I hope that I will be able to use them well in my codes.
