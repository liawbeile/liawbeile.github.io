- Visualizing Data for Classification
- Exploratory data analysis
- Examine classes and class imbalance
- Visualize class separation by numeric features
    - Box plots
    - Violin plots
- Visualize class separation by categorical features
    - Bar charts      

These are my notes taken from Microsoft Learning's Principles of Machine Learning in Python - Module 2.

## What I learnt:  

### Visualizing Data for Classification

**Method:** Visualize and explore data (exploratory data analysis) 
- Examine the imbalance in the label cases using a frequency table.
- Find numeric or categorical features that separate the cases using visualization.

**Goal:** To explore a dataset about automobile pricing to determine which features may be useful in predicting the customers with bad credit. 
- for classification problems, we are looking for features that help separate the label categories.
- To understand which features are useful for class separation.

I have reviewed and went through  Visualizing Data for Classification for german bank credit in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/documents/visualizing_german_credit_data_for_classification.ipynb).
