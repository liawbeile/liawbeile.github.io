# Anaconda  

### Install Anaconda  

We usually use Anaconda to create environments for isolating our projects that use different versions of Python and/or different version of packages.  

We also use it to install, uninstall, and update packages in our project environments.  

[Installation](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) 

### Create new environment  
Anaconda Navigator > Environment > Create new environment  

# VSCode:  

### Install VSCode  

Visual Studio Code is a code editor and IDE, an environment for programming projects or working on text files.  

[Installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  

### Select environment   
VSCode > “CTRL + Shift + P” to open the command palette. > type “Python: Select Interpreter” > Select your environment  

### To create a new file, e.g. in projects folder in desktop  
Click file icon on left (for now, since no Linux yet as I'm using Windows)

### To delete a file  
Delete manually in computer folder (for now, since no Linux yet as I'm using Windows)  
- You can't be inside the folder/ file if you want to delete that particular file  
(enter 'pwd' to check which folder or file you are in)  
(consider entering 'cd ..' in terminal if you are in the folder/ file that you want to delete)  

## In the editor of GUI VSCode:  
### Save code    
Ctrl+S  

### Import & use function from insider one file to the other  
E.g. if there's 2 files, calculator.py and main.py, in main.py file's editor, 
- can type one line of code, ***'import calculator'*** OR  
- ***'from calculator import sum_all'*** *(custom function name in calculator.py)*  
then can type e.g. ***number_sum = calculator.sum_all(num1,num2)***  

## In the terminal of GUI VSCode:   
### Run code in VSCode terminal:  
- Go to terminal and insert/ type in: *python .\filename.py*  
- Enter to run code  

### Stop the code from running in VSCode terminal:  
- Go to terminal and Ctrl+C  

### Terminal Commands:  
**rm** -> remove  
- e.g.  rm .\filename.py

**cp** -> copy  
- e.g. cp .\file1name.py .\file2name.py

**mv** -> rename  
- e.g. mv .\oldfilename.py .\newfilename.py  

**ls** -> list  
- e.g. ls .\foldername\  

**pwd** -> print working directory (see what is the current folder or file you are in)  
**cd** -> change directory  
- e.g. cd .\foldername\  

**cd ..** -> go to the directory containing the file or folder you are currently in  
- e.g. your current directory is desktop\learnpython, then you use *cd ..* to go to desktop  

**mkdir** -> make directory (create a new folder)  
- e.g. mkdir nameofnewdirectory (don't need .\ in front)  

**cp-r** -> copy all (recursively select all)  
- e.g. cp - r .\folderone\ .\foldertwo\  
(moves all files in folder one to folder two)  

press **up/down keys** -> cycle past commands  
press **tab** -> to get file name quickly via autofill  

**touch** -> create a new file (for linux)  
**rm-rf** -> (same as above, but for linux)
