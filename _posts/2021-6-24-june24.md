- Visualizing Data for Regression
- Exploratory data analysis
- Matplotlib, Pandas plotting & Seaborn
- Different chart types:
    - Single axis view of data:
        - Univariate plot types
            - Bar charts
            - Histograms
            - Kernel density estimation (kde) plots
            - Combining histograms and kdes
        - 2-dimensional plot types
            - Scatter plots
            - Dealing with Overplotting
                - transparency
                - Countour plots or 2d density plots
                - Hexbin plots
            - For categorical (non-numeric) variables:
                - Box plots
                - Violin plots
        - Using Aesthetics
            - Marker shape, size and colour
    - Multi-axis views of data
        - Pair-wise scatter plots or scatter plot matrices
        - Conditioned plots, facetted plots or small multiple plots use group-by operations

These are my notes taken from Microsoft Learning's Principles of Machine Learning in Python - Module 2.

## What I learnt:  

### Visualizing Data for Regression

**Method:** Visualize and explore data (exploratory data analysis) by summarizing data & developing multiple views of data using multiple chart types.  

**Goal:** To  explore a dataset about automobile pricing to determine which features may be useful in predicting automobile prices.
- to understand the relationships between the data columns.
- to identify features that may be useful for predicting labels

I have reviewed and went through  Visualizing Data for Regression for automobile prices in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/documents/visualising_automobile_price_data_for_regression.ipynb).
