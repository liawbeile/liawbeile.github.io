title:  Week 4 - Using assignment operators, custom functions within functions, return values
categories: Learning Python Practices Reflections
---

1. Assignment operators: count=count+1 can be written as count+=1 and so on. Same for *= and -= etc.
2. Using custom functions within custom functions  
3. Returning more than 1 value - returns the values as items in a tuple.  
Need to create multiple variables (not just 1) for the returned values.  
Can create more than 1 variable for items in list, tuple, strings etc.  

& dry run codes when there are bugs (to figure out what went wrong).

## What I learnt:  

### 1. Using += , *= , -= etc. to increment and decrement  
### 2. Using custom functions within custom functions  

- *Find length of list & multiple and sum of items in list without using len( ) or sum( ) inbuilt functions.*  
 *Use f strings.*
```python
a_list=[2,5,7,1]
def length_of_list(list1):
    count=0
    for number in list1:
        count+=1
    return count
def multiples(list1):
    times=1
    for number in list1:
        times*=number
    return times
def sum_all(list1):
    summed=0
    for number in list1:
        summed+=number
    return summed
length=length_of_list(a_list)
multiple=multiples(a_list)
summed=sum_all(a_list)
print(f"The length, sum and product are {length}, {summed} and {multiple}.")
```  
\- *Continued:* -  
    *For another list of numbers, use the above 3 functions created previously into one custom function and get the length, sum and product of the list.*
```python
diff_list=[1, 2, 3, 4]
def list_info(onelist):
# don't need to put: "for numbers in onelist:"
    added=sum_all(onelist)
    multiplied=multiples(onelist)
    length=length_of_list(onelist)
    return added, multiplied, length
list_information=list_info(diff_list)
print(f"The sum, multiple and length of list is {list_information}.")
```

- *Find the length of a string without using len( ) function.*  
 *Use f strings.*
```python
string_1="This is a cat"
def find_length(a_string):
    count=0
    for character in a_string:
        count+=1
    return count
string_length=find_length(string_1)
print(f"Length of string is {string_length}.")
```  
\- *Continued:* -  
    *For another string, use the above function created previously into one custom function and get the length of the longest word in the string.*  
    *Use max( ) inbuilt function.*
```python
'''split the sentence into many strings of separate words'''
'''find length of each word and append the length to a list'''
'''use max( ) on the list to find max word length'''
string_2="This is a dog"
def get_longest_wordlength(onestring):
    newlist=onestring.split(' ')
    listoflengths=[]
    for word in newlist:
        wordlength=find_length(word)
        listoflengths.append(wordlength)
    return max(listoflengths)
get_longest_wordlength(string_2)
```

### 3. Returning more than 1 value - returns the values as items in a tuple  
### Can create more than 1 variable for items in list, tuple, strings etc.

- *Find the length of longest word, length of the whole string & frequency of each character in the string in a dictionary.*  
 *All above using 1 custom function*  
```python
mystring="the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog in singapore"
# practise this! ***
def mydictionary(onestring):
    d={}
    for character in onestring:
        if character in d:
            d[character]=d[character]+1
        else:
            d[character]=1
    return d
def string_info(thestring):
    '''using custom fxn in above prev example'''
    length_of_word=get_longest_wordlength(thestring)
    '''using custom fxn in above prev example'''
    string_length=find_length(thestring)
    '''using custom fxn in code above here'''
    thedictionary=mydictionary(thestring)
    '''return 3 values at once'''
    return length_of_word, string_length, thedictionary
'''create 3 variables to store the 3 returned values from the custom fxn'''
length_of_word, string_length, thedictionary=string_info(mystring)
print(f"The length of word is {length_of_word}, string length is {string_length}, and frequency of character is {thedictionary}.")
```  

When you return more than 1 value, it gets gets returned as a tuple:  
- example  
```python
countries=['India', 'Singapore']
country1, country2=countries
print(country1, country2)
```  
_Output:_
```
India 
Singapore
```   

- example:  
```python
letter1, letter2='12'
print(letter1, letter2)
```  
_Output:_
```
1 
2
```

## Thoughts

Custom functions are a bit tricky for me at the moment, especially when we have to insert them into other custom functions for specific tasks/ outputs. The difficult part is getting familiar with where to insert the custom function & figuring out the arguments needed for the custom functions.  

I will be doing more practices on custom functions and using them, so that I can familiarise and be more confident when using these custom functions.
