1. open('filename.txt','r/r+/a/w/w+/x')  
2. File attributes:
    - .readline(): Read only one line of the file
    - .readlines(): Read multiple lines of the file as a list of strings  
    - .write(): Open an existing file and write to it  
    - .read(): loads the content of the file into memory as a string, including formatting such as new line (\n)  
    - .read(n): reading a file where n = number of characters to read  
    - seek(index): go back to indicated line  
3. .close(): open file takes memory so we can use the .close() method to free resources.

## What I learnt:  

### Create a file in VSCode:
We can create an empty file in VSCode using 'file_name.txt' as the format of the file name.  

### 1. File modes for text files:  
open('filename.txt','r/r+/a/w/w+/x/...')  
**'r'** - read: opens a file for reading  
**'r+**' - read and write mode  
**'w'** - write: overwrite the content  
**'[w+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w)'** - write: read and write mode. Overwrites existing file if file exists. If file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing  
**'a'** - append: opens file to append to the end of the file  

and there are [more modes of opening files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w)...  

### File attributes  

**'with' and 'as f'**:  
It is good practice to always use 'with' and 'as f' where possible.

**a. .readline( )**: Read only one line of the file  
- Reading a File and Printing its Content   
- Good Practice:  
```python    
with open('random.txt', 'r') as f:
    while True:
        line=f.readline()
        if line:
            print(line)
        else:
            break
```  

- Bad Practice,  
Don't use this because if forget to close(), this will take up a lot of space over time.  
Just know this works too:  
```python
text_file=open('random.txt', 'r')
while True:
    line=text_file.readline()
    if line:
        print(line)
    else:
        break
text_file.close()
```  

**b. .readlines( )**: Read multiple lines of the file as a list of strings & **.close( )** to close file   

- Read all lines at once.  
Good Practice:  
```python  
with open('random.txt', 'r') as fp:
    lines=fp.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line)
```  

- Import file to jupyter notebook using !curl, then Read all lines.  
Good Practice:  
```python
!curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/intropython/master/poem1.txt -o poem1.txt
with open('poem1.txt', 'r') as f:
    poem_lines = f.readlines()
    for line in poem_lines:
        print(line)
```  

- Bad practice, avoid:  
```python
!curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/intropython/master/poem1.txt -o poem1.txt
poem1 = open('poem1.txt', 'r')
poem_lines = poem1.readlines()
for line in poem_lines:
    print(line)
poem1.close()
```  

- Read one line at a time as a string and remove the newline character '\n' for every line being read
```python
!curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/intropython/master/poem1.txt -o poem1.txt
with open('poem1.txt', 'r') as f:
    poem_line = f.readline().strip('\n')
    while poem_line:
        print(poem_line.capitalize())
        poem_line = f.readline().strip('\n')  
```  

- When we use readlines to create a text file into a list of strings, it gives us unwanted newline ("\n") characters sometimes.  
Remove newline characters from lists created using .readlines().  
    - line[:-1] sets the end point at the last character of the string, the result is the '\n' (newline) character is omitted  

```python
'''open file and read file as a list of strings'''
with open('poem1.txt', 'r') as f:
    poem_lines = f.readlines()
    print(poem_lines)
    '''print each list item''' 
    for line in poem_lines:
        print(line)
    '''remove the last character of each list item, which is "\n"'''
    count = 0
    for line in poem_lines:
        poem_lines[count] = line[:-1]
        count += 1
    print(poem_lines)
    '''print each list item''' 
    for line in poem_lines:
        print(line)
```  

**c. .write( ) & 'w'**  
- Write to a File  
```python  
print('Writing to File')
list_of_countries=['Singapore', 'India', 'China', 'Japan']
with open('country_list.txt', 'w') as f:
    for country in list_of_countries:
        f.write(country)
        f.write('\n')
print('Done Writing to File')
```  

**d. .write( ) & 'a'**  
- Appending another country e.g. USA into a text file of country names
```python  
with open('country_list.txt', 'a') as f:
    f.write('USA')
```

**e. .read( )**  
- Import file to jupyter notebook using !curl, then  
Read file (loads the content of the file into memory) as a string / reading a file.  
.read(n) where n is the number of characters to read  
```python  
!curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/intropython/master/poem1.txt -o poem1.txt
with open('poem1.txt', 'r') as f:
    poem_contents = f.read()
    print(poem_contents)
    poem_contents = f.read(10)
    print(poem_contents)
```  

**f. .seek( ) & 'w+'**  
```python
with open('somefile.txt', 'w+') as f:
'''Note that f has now been truncated to 0 bytes, so you'll only be able to read data that you write after this point''' 
    f.write('somedata\n')
    f.seek(0)  
    '''Important: return to the top of the file before reading, otherwise you'll just read an empty string'''
    data = f.read()
```  

- **.read( ), .readline( ) returns a string. These strings can be manipulated just like any other string.**  
    - Boolean tests such as:  
.upper()  
.title()  
string slices, e.g.- cities[3:9]  
etc..  
    - String methods can be performed such as:  
.isdigit()  
.isalpha()  
etc...  

```python
with open('poem1.txt', 'r') as f:
    poem_part = f.read(15).upper()
    print(poem_part)
```

## Thoughts

After learning these, I am more prepared to handle text files in Python. There were quite a number of things to know, such as the various file attributes and ways of using the different file modes. I found it good for me to have learnt the good practice vs the not so good practice, as it would help to save me some trouble in the future. I will practise more on files to get familiar with handling text files, do look out for my next post!
