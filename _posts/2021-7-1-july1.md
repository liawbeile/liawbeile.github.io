- Linear regression using scikit-learn
- Use categorical data
- Apply transformations to features and labels to improve model performance
- Compare regression models to improve model performance
- **Prepare the model matrix**
    - Create dummy variables from categorical features
    - Concatenate the numeric features
- **Data preparation**
    - **Split the dataset**
        - create independently sampled training dataset and test data set
        - .train_test_split( ) to perform Bernoulli sampling
    - **Scale numeric features**
        - Z-Score normalization
            - .StandardScaler( ) then .transform( )
- **Construct the regression model**
    - **Instantiate and fit the model**
        - .LinearRegression( ) & .fit( )
        - print the intercept term and model coefficients
- **Evaluate model performance**
    - **Plot the predicted values computed** from the training features
            - The predict method is applied to the model with the training data
    - Using the test dataset
    - Choose & compute **performance metric**
        - Mean squared error or MSE
        - Root mean squred error or RMSE
        - Mean absolute error or MAE
        - Median absolute error
        - R squared or  ùëÖ2 , also known as the coefficient of determination
        - Adjusted R squared
    - **Residuals (errors) of the model should be Normally distributed**
        - plot a kernel density plot and histogram of the residuals of the regression model
        - Quantile-Quantile Normal plot, or Q-Q Normal plot 
            - If the residuals have a distribution which is approximately Normal, points will nearly fall along the straight line
        - Residual plot

These are my notes taken from Microsoft Learning's Principles of Machine Learning in Python - Module 4.

## What I learnt:  

### Applying Linear Regression

**Goal of regression:** To construct a linear regression model to predict the price of automobiles from their characteristics 

I have reviewed and went through Applying Linear Regression for automobile prices in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/documents/applying_linear_regression.ipynb).
