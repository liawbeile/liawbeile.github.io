- Supervised machine learning terminologies
- Classification model
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm

These are my notes taken from Microsoft Learning's Principles of Machine Learning in Python - Module 1.

## What I learnt:  

### Overview of KNN classification
**Method:** Use randomly selected cases to first train and then evaluate a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) machine learning model.  
**Goal:** To predict the type or class of the label / classify cases with unknown labels.  

**To create and evaluate a KNN machine learning classification model:**  
- Load and explore data using visualization to determine if the features separate the classes.
- Prepare data by normalizing the numeric features and randomly sampling into training and testing subsets.
- Construct and evaluate the machine learning model. 
- Evaluation performed by statistically, with accuracy metric and visualization.

I have reviewed and went through the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm for iris flowers in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/knn_iris_classification_model_machine_learning.ipynb).
