title:  Week 4 - Programming patterns across languages & using pass, flag, break
categories: Learning Python Practices Reflections
---

1. Programming patterns  
2. Using *pass* in custom functions
3. Using a flag & *break* in a for loop

Then, I did some practice problems.

### What I learnt:  

**1. Programming Patterns:**
- Different Programming Languages have different syntax.
    - Syntax: Language-specific code rules.
- But they all have some common themes: print, loops, function
- Programming Patterns are good ways to write code across diffferent languages  
    - **Example:**  
        - Python:  
        ```python
        for something in some_list:
            print(something)
        def func():
            print("hello")
        ```  
        - Java: structs, switch-cases  
        ```java
        for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
            System.out.println(i)
        }
        public static void main():{
            System.out.println()
        }
        ```

    **1a. How to sum values in a list**  
    declare variable sum  
    loop through list  
    sum=sum+item  

    **1b. Check if item meets condition**  
    loop through a list  
    if conditional is true (if statement)  
    then do something  
    or do something else  

    **1c. Flag**  
    set flag to default value  
    loop through list  
    if condition is true  
    then set flag  
    exit loop  
    if flag is set  
    do something  
    or do something else  

    **1d. Minimum or max of a list**  

**2. Using *pass***  
- when creating a custom function without typing in its code/function at first -  
to prevent errors, in case custom function is incomplete  
```python
number_input=int(input("Number: "))
def check_prime(the_number):
    pass
check_prime(number_input)
```  

**3. Using a flag and *break* in a for loop**  

### Practices  

- *Create a function to check if a number is a prime*  
```python
'''Use flag, use range( )'''
'''Get number input. Set flag=0 by default, if number is not prime, flag=1 and break'''  
'''(so that program stops checking other numbers after that within the range).'''

def check_prime(the_number):
    flag=0
    for number in range(2,the_number):
        if the_number%number==0:
            flag=1
            break
    if flag==0:
        print("Number is prime")
    else:
        print("Number is not prime")
number_input=int(input("Number: "))
check_prime(number_input)
```  

**More Other Practices**   
- *Create a function to generate a list of all the factors of a number*  
```python
'''use range( ), use list.append( ) to an empty list'''

def factor_list(inserted_number):
    list_of_factors=[]
    for number in range(1,inserted_number+1):
        if inserted_number%number==0:
            list_of_factors.append(number)
    print(list_of_factors)
number_input=int(input("Number: "))
factor_list(number_input)
```

## Thoughts

It's great to learn about some of the good coding practices and learning Python definitely would make learning other languages in the future easier for me!
