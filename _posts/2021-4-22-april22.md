Previously, I learnt the attributes of different data types. - append, extend, pop, join for lists; split for strings.  

1. Today, I learnt more string attributes -  
    - capitalize, title, upper, lower  
    - index, find, search 
    - count  
    - startswith, endswith  
    - strip  
2. String index & String slicing  
There are many ways to substring a string.  
This is called ‘slicing’. Also can reverse a string. 
3. Check if substring in string  
4. Iterate through a string or sub string  
5. [Old method of string formatting](https://www.learnpython.org/en/String_Formatting) using % *(for reference only, I'll be using f-strings instead)*

## What I learnt:  

### 1. String Attributes  
- For strings, I learnt how to use **string.capitalize( ), string.title( ), string.upper( ), string.lower( )** attributes
```python
x='hello there'
print(x.title())
print(x.capitalize())
print(x.upper())
print(x.lower())
```  
*Output:*
```
Hello There
Hello there
HELLO THERE
hello there
```

- **[string.index( )](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/index), string.find( ), string.search( )** attributes  
[5 Ways to Find the Index of a Substring in Python](https://betterprogramming.pub/5-ways-to-find-the-index-of-a-substring-in-python-13d5293fc76d)    
1. **str.find()**  
2. str.rfind()  
3. **str.index()**  
4. str.rindex()  
5. re.search()  
```python
sentence = 'Python programming is fun.'
result = sentence.index('is fun')
print("Substring 'is fun':", result)
```  
*Output:*
```
Substring 'is fun': 19
```  
```python
"this is fun".find("fun")
```  
*Output:*
```
8
```
- **string.count( )** attribute  
```python
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring.count("l"))
```  
*Output:*
```
3
```
- **string.startswith( ), string.endswith( )** attribute  
```python
astring = "Hello world!"
print(astring.startswith("Hello"))
print(astring.endswith("asdfasdfasdf"))
```  
_Output:_
```
True
False
```  

    ```python
    if "substring".startswith("sub"):
        print("substring starts with sub")
    ```  
    *Output:*
    ```
    substring starts with sub
    ```
- **[string.strip('chars')](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/string/strip)** attribute  
```python
string = '  xoxo love xoxo   '
# Leading and trailing whitespaces are removed
print(string.strip())
# All <whitespace>,x,o,e characters in the left and right of string are removed
print(string.strip(' xoe'))
# Argument doesn't contain space
# No characters are removed.
print(string.strip('stx'))
# Argument doesn't contain space
# 'an' is removed.
string = 'android is awesome'
print(string.strip('an'))
```  

### 2. String index, [String Slicing](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-substring-a-string-in-python/) & Reversing a string
- string_name[index] to find character in the stated position.  
- index can be negative from -1, -2 etc... to get character in the last position and so on working backwards.  
```python
student_name='Colette'
if student_name[0].lower="c":
    print("Winner! Name starts with 'C'")
```
1. **string[start:end]**  
Get all characters from index start to end-1
2. **string[:end]**  
Get all characters from the beginning of the string to end-1
3. **string[start:]**  
Get all characters from index start to the end of the string
4. **string[start:end:step]**  
Get all characters from start to end-1 discounting  
```python
s = "Hey there! what should this string be?"
print(f"Length of s = {len(s)}")
print(f"The first occurrence of the letter a = {s.index('a')}")
print(f"a occurs {s.count('a')} times")
# Slicing the string into bits
print(f"The first five characters are '{s[:5]}'") # Start to 5
print(f"The next five characters are '{s[5:10]}'")  # 5 to 10
print(f"The thirteenth character is '{s[12]}'") # Just number 12
print(f"The characters with odd index are '{s[1::2]}'") #(0-based indexing)
```  
_Output:_
```
Length of s = 38
The first occurrence of the letter a = 13
a occurs 1 times
The first five characters are 'Hey t'
The next five characters are 'here!'
The thirteenth character is 'h'
The characters with odd index are 'e hr!wa hudti tigb?'
```  
Read a string backwards
```python
astring = "!figt"
print(astring[::-1])
```  
_Output:_
```
tgif!
```  

### 3. Check if substring in string
```python
if "fun" in "this is fun":
    print("'this is fun' contains the word 'fun'.")
```  
_Output:_
```
this is fun contains the word fun.
```  

### 4. Iterate through a string or sub string  
Use *for variable_name in string_name* or  
*for variable_name in string_name[x:x:x]*  
```python
for item in her_name:
```
```python
for letter in vegetable_name:
```

## Thoughts

I managed to learn many new attributes of strings today, which is really great to know! String indexing and slicing is especially complicated due to the numbering(s) and I did read up more to learn more about how slice positions work.
