---

Today was the first day of my programming journey with the guidance of my mentor, Soham. We will be focusing on learning about Python. We mainly covered the basics of Python, such as basic functions, operators, using variables, different data types, loops, and also did a few practice exercises as below.  

## Cheatsheets

I also learnt how to use markdown text syntax and on using useful online 'cheatsheets'. These are the ones that I found and am using:
- Markdown cheatsheets: [Markdown basic](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) \| [Markdown extended](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)  
- Python cheatsheet: [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)

## What I learnt:  

### 1. Basic functions  

- **print( )**
```python
print("Hello world")
```
    - the **print()** function prints out the string (of texts) that is surrounded by " ", in this case it prints *Hello world*  

- **input( )**
```python
name=input('Please enter your name')
print(name)
```
    - the value on the right would be the input that the user types in after seeing the prompt *Please enter your name* (the string within the ' ' in the function), as we use **input( )** function to ask for user input 
    - the variable, which I named *name*, is assigned the value on the right as I used the **=** operator
    - I used print( ) function to print the variable *name* which was assigned the value that the user typed in.  
    The user input will be printed.  

- **type( )**
    - gives the data type of the output, e.g. string / integer / float...
```python
name=input('Please enter your name')
print(type(name))
```
        - If someone enters a name e.g. 'John', the output will show data type string

### 2.	Math operators  

- __**__ to the power of
- __%__ 
- __/__ 
- __\+__ 
- __\-__ 
- __//__ “floor” division (rounds down to nearest whole number), removes any remainders after division
- __\*__
```python
print(6/3)
print(4*5)
print(5**2)
print(11%2)
print(1==2)
print(1==1)
1+2
3+2
```
    - the first 4 lines of codes above prints the values within the brackets which are the result of the mathematical formulae within (respectively: division, mutiplication, to the power of, remainder of).
    - the 5th and 6th lines of code prints the result of the expressions as True or False.  
    In this case, 1==2 is false since 1 is not equal 2, and the print( ) function gives the output *False*, while 1==1 is True and the print( ) function gives the output *True*
    - as we did not specify a print( ) function for the last 2 lines of code, the program only prints the result of the last line, 3+2, which is 5. 

### 3.	Variables  

- Store values into a __variable__   
    ```python
    number = 10+2
    second_number=number*5
    print(number, second_number)
    ```
    - the variable which I named *number* is assigned the value on the right, which is 12 (the sum of 10 and 2)
    - the next variable which I named *second_variable* will be assigned the value on the right, which is variable\*5 and that is also 12*5, which is the result 60
    - the *print( )* function prints out both variables, giving us their assigned values 12 60  

### 4.	Data Types  

-	__Boolean expressions__: returns a value of True/ False
-	__Comparisons__ ==, !=, is (different from ==)
```python
a = 3==2
b = 3==3
c = True
print(a, b, c)
```
    - for the 1st line, on the right the expression is false, giving a result *False*.  
    *a* being the variable on the left is assigned the value on the right, *False*
    - for the 2nd line, on the right the expression is true, giving a result *True*.  
    *b* being the variable on the left is assigned the value on the right, *True*
    - for the 3rd line, on the right the value is True.  
    *c* being the variable on the left is assigned the value on the right, *True*  

- **is** operator gives true if it refers to the same object  
(false even if they are equal, if they are not same)  
```python
x = [1,2,3]
y = [1,2,3]
z = x
print(x == y) # Prints out True
print(x is y) # Prints out False
print(z is x) # Prints out True
```  

- **not** operator -  
using "not" before a boolean expression inverts it
```python
print(not False) # Prints out True
print((not False) == (False)) # Prints out False
```  

-	__Numeric Types__ —  
int, float, etc
```python
int_number=12
float_number=12.2
print(int_number, float_number)
```  

- **and** operator
```python
#check if a and b is true
#use if a and b:
a=True
b=True
if a and b:
    print("a and b are true")
```
    - In the first 2 lines of code, we have 2 variables which were each assigned the numbers on the right (an integer (whole number) and a float (number with decimals))
    - For the last line of code, using print( ) funtion, we print the 2 variables and the output is their assigned values 12 12.2  

-	**Text – strings**
    - Strings can be printed by using **single ' ' or double quotation " " marks** within the print( ) function
    ```python
    print('This is a string with 1 quotation mark')
    print("This is a string with two quotation marks")
    string1='string1'
    string2="string2"
    print(string1, string2)
    ```
        - For the first 2 lines of codes, we print the strings within the print( ) function surrounded by ' ' or " "  
        - Output:  
        ```
        This is a string with 1 quotation mark
        *This is a string with two quotation marks
        ```
        - For the 3rd & 4th lines of code, we have 2 variables which were each assigned the values on the right, which are strings  
        - For the last line of code, using print( ) function, we print the 2 variables - Output:  
        ```
        string1
        string2
        ```

- __Operators (conditions) – and, or__	
- __List__: [1, 2, 3]  and __Nested List__: [1, 2, [3, 'hello']]
-	__Tuple__: (1, 2, 3)  
-	__Dictionary__: {key: value, key_2: value_2}
```python
my_first_list=[1, 2, 'apple', 'orange', True, False, 5, ['inside_list', 2, 3, 4]]
print(my_first_list)
```
    - we named a variable *my_first_list* and assigned it the value on the right, which is a list as shown by values surrounded within [ ] square brackets.  
    - This list has a list nested within it too as seen from [ ] within the [ ]
    - using print( ) function, we print the variable which gives the output of its assigned value, the list [ 1, 2, 'apple', 'orange', True, False, 5, [ 'inside_list', 2, 3, 4] ]  
```python
countries=['Singapore', 'India', 'Malaysia', 'Australia']
print(countries[0])
print(countries[1:4])
print(len(countries))
countries.append('Japan')
countries[2]='China'
```
    - 1st line: the *countries* variable is assigned to a list which is on the right (in this case it is a list of country names)
    - 2nd line: countries[0] takes the value at the 1st position of the list, as the position count goes incrementally starting from 0 in arrays.  
    Here, it is the string *Singapore*  
    Using print( ) I printed the value assigned to variable *countries[0]* which is the string *Singapore*
    - 3rd line: countries[1:4] takes the values at the 2nd to 4th positions of the list, as the position count goes incrementally starting from 0 in arrays & it is list[n:n-1] positions when retrieving values using arrays.  
    Here, the values are the strings *India* *Malaysia* *Australia* which are in the 2nd to 4th positions
    Using print( ) I printed the values in the specified positions of the list assigned to variable *countries* which are the strings *India* *Malaysia* *Australia*
    - 4th line: len( ) function returns the length of the data, here it returns the length of the *countries* variable  which was assigned to a list.  
    The length of the list, which is the number of values inside the list, is retrieved by len( ).  
    As there are 4 strings in the list, len(countries) gives the result of 4.  
    Using print( ), the output 4 is printed.
    - 5th line: we used the append attribute of a list to add a string at the last position of the list that was assigned to variable *countries*, by using countries.append('Japan'), the *countries* variable now is assigned to a list _['Singapore', 'India', 'Malaysia', 'Australia', 'Japan']_
    - Last line: countries[2]='China' changes the value in the 3rd position of the list, 'Malaysia', to 'China'.  
    The *countries* variable changes to a list _['Singapore', 'India', 'Malaysia', 'Australia', 'Japan']_  
    As it is on the last line, although there is no print( ) function used, this list is printed out.  
```python
numbers=[1284, 2480, 482034, 38405, 38402840, 47284, 38980, 17390]
for number in numbers:
    if number%5==0 or number%2==0:
        print(number)
```
    - 1st line: the *numbers* variable is assigned to a list which is on the right (in this case it is a list of integers)  
    - 2nd line: in the list assigned to the variable *numbers*, for each element in the list from left to right (one by one), assign the current element to a variable which we call *number*  
    - 3rd line: if the remainder of the element (*number*) after division by 5 or by 2 is 0, 
    - 4th line: print the element (*number*) within the *numbers* list that fulfils this criteria.  Repeat 3rd & 4th line for the next element in the list.
    - In this case, those elements (*number*) within the list which are divisible by 5 and 2 exactly will be printed, and the resulting output is 1248 2480 482034 38405 38402840 47284 38980 17390  

### 5.	Loops / conditions - if, elif, else  
```python
if a == b: print("a is equal to b")
```
- Simple calculator program:
```python
# Program asks user for 2 numbers 
# and a operation (sum, subtract, power, div)
# then prints the output
number1=int(input('Number one: '))
number2=int(input('Number two: '))  
print(type(number1))
a=input("Operation: ")  
if a=='sum':
    print(number1+number2)
elif a=='minus':
    print(number1-number2)
elif a=='times':
    print(number1*number2)
elif a=='divide':
    print(number1/number2)
else:
    print('Try again')
```
    - For the first 2 lines of codes, using the input( ) function, I prompted the user who will see strings *Number one:* and *Number two:* to input values  
    - as I used the int( ) function, I specify that the user must input integer values only
    - I assigned variables *number1* and *number2* to the integer values on the right which the user will input
    - 3rd line: **type( )** function prints the type of the value assigned to variable *number1*, in this case its an integer value, therefore <class 'int'> is printed
    - 4th line: I prompted the user who will see string *Operation:* to input a value.  
     variable *a* is assigned to the value on the right which the user inputs.
    - 5th & 6th line: if the value of *a* equals to the string *sum*, print the value of the result of number1+number2 using print( )
    - 7th & 8th line: else if the condition in the previous lines is not met (*a* is not equals to the string *sum*) but is equal to the string *minus*, print the value of the result of number1-number2 using print( )
    - 9th to 12th lines: similar to 7th & 8th line's logic but for *a* equals to times or divide respectively and printing the results of the expressions stated within print( ) 
    - Last 2 lines: if none of the criterias stated above were met/ were true, print the string indicated which is *Try again*  

- Simple calculator program using list:  
```python
operations=['sum', 'minus', 'times']
number1=10
number2=20
for operation in operations:
    if operation=='sum':
        print(number1+number2)
    elif operation=='minus':
        print(number1-number2)
    elif operation=='times':
        print(number1*number2)
    else:
        print('Try again')
```
    - 1st line: I assigned the variable named *operations* to the list on the right, which is a list of strings (of operations)
    - 2nd & 3rd lines: I assigned variables *number1* and *number2* to the values on the right which are 10 and 20 respectively
    - 4th line: for elements in the list, assign them to a variable which we call *operation*  
    - 5th line: if the element (*operation*) is the string *sum*, 
    - 6th line: print the results of the expressions stated within print( ), in this case it is number1+number2.
    - 7th & 8th line: else if the condition in the previous lines is not met (*operation* is not equals to the string *sum*), but is equal to the string *minus*, print the value of the result of number1-number2 using print( )
    - 9th & 10th line: else if the conditions in the previous lines are not met (*operation* is not equals to the string *sum* or *minus*), but is equal to the string *times*, print the value of the result of number1*number2 using print( )
    - Last 2 lines: if none of the criterias stated above were met/ were true, print the string indicated which is *Try again*

## Thoughts

It was a fulfilling day of learning Python basics and I feel more confident in Python, as I practised on some basic programming exercises. I'm especially happy to have made a basic calculator program!   

### Additional Resource(s):
The site that I further used to obtain programming exercises to practise on is:
- Programming exercises: [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)  

### Debugging

In my practices, there were a few programming bugs, so I spent some time to look through my codes, thought about what possibly went wrong, and successfully debugged some of my programs that needed fixing.  

Debugging was actually quite fun, as it allowed me to learn from my mistakes.
