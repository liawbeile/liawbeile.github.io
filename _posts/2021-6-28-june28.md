- Linear regression using scikit-learn
- Overview of linear regression
- Data preparation
    - Split the dataset
        - create independently sampled training dataset and test data set
        - .train_test_split( ) to perform Bernoulli sampling
    - Scale numeric features
        - Min-Max normalization
        - Z-Score normalization
            - .StandardScaler( ) then .transform( )
- Train the regression model
    - instantiate and fit the model
        - .LinearRegression( ) & .fit( )
        - print the model coefficients
    - plot the predicted values computed from the training features
        - The predict method is applied to the model with the training data
- Evaluate model performance
    - using the test dataset
    - choose & compute performance metric
        - Mean squared error or MSE
        - Root mean squred error or RMSE
        - Mean absolute error or MAE
        - Median absolute error
        - R squared or  ùëÖ2 , also known as the coefficient of determination
        - Adjusted R squared
    - residuals (errors) of the model should be Normally distributed
        - plot a kernel density plot and histogram of the residuals of the regression model
        - Quantile-Quantile Normal plot, or Q-Q Normal plot 
            - If the residuals have a distribution which is approximately Normal, points will nearly fall along the straight line
        - Residual plot

## What I learnt:  

### Introduction to Regression

**Method:** Train the model to minimize the difference between our predicted $\hat{y}$ and the known label values $y$.

**Goal of regression** To produce a model that represents the ‚Äòbest fit‚Äô to some observed data. Find a function of some features $X$ which predicts the label value $y$. 

I have reviewed and went through  Introduction to Regression in this [**link**](https://github.com/liawbeile/liawbeile.github.io/blob/master/documents/intro_to_regression.ipynb).
