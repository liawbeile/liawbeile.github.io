# Titanic  
## Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis using Python  

This is my first ever Exploratory Data Analysis project.   

I will be learning about & using Pandas and Seaborn for my data analysis and visualisation using the Titanic dataset.  

I'm super excited to get started. Let's find out who would most likely survive the Titanic and explore the factors that might have played a part in determining the fate of the passengers!

## Thoughts

I am quite pleased to have obtained many interesting insights from the Titanic dataset!  

This project is one which I did while learning the basics of Pandas and Seaborn. I believe that I will be able to fine tune it using more complex functions which I learnt only recently (as per previous posts), and perhaps incorporate machine learning techniques on my project(s) in the near future.    

In the meantime, I will be focusing on learning more Python modules/ features and about machine learning. Do keep a look out for my future projects and posts!
