## What I learnt:  

### Escape sequences  

Escape sequences allow us to include special characters in strings.  

We can add a backslash \ before the character we want to escape.

- **'** apostrophe within single quotes
```python
sentence = 'Hey, that\'s my bag.'
print(sentence)
```  
*Output:*
```
Hey, that's my bag.
```  

- **'' ''** quotes within quotes
```python
sentence = "They are the so-called \"cool kids\" in school."
print(sentence)
```  
*Output:*
```
They are the so-called "cool kids" in school.
```  

- **\n** to create a new line and generate multi-line strings.  
```python
print("Hello this is\na random\nstring.")
```  
*Output:*
```
Hello this is
a random
string.
```  

- **\t** tab  
```python
print("Hello this is\n\ta random\n\t\tstring.")
```  
*Output:*
```
Hello this is
    a random
        string.
```  

- __\\__ backslash character
```python
print("C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop")
```  
*Output:*
```
C:\Users\Me\Desktop
```  

- **Raw strings** treats backslash \ as a literal character.   
A raw string can be used by prefixing the string with r or R, allowing backslashes without needing to escape them.  
But unescaped backslashes at the end of a raw string will cause an error.  
```python
print(r"Backslashes \ don't need to be escaped in raw strings.")
```
*Output:*
```
Backslashes don't need to be escaped in raw strings.
```

### Extra mini tips for the basics  

- **input( )** function always gives a string value by default

- We can duplicate the same string multiple times, **using ***
```python
string = 'Ann'
print(string*3)
```
*Output:*
```
AnnAnnAnn 
```

- **Combining variables/ values**:  
    - **comma ,** gives a space between values  
    - meanwhile, **+ is concatenate** and doesn't give a space between outputs
        - \+ will not work if using different data types e.g. string + integer
```python
string1='hello'
print(string1,'Joe')
print(string1+'Joe')
```
*Output:*
```
hello Joe
helloJoe
```  
    - can use **f strings to concatenate** as well **f"{ } { }"**
```python
firstname = "Joe"
lastname = "Tan"
print(f"{firstname} {lastname}")
```
*Output:*
```
Joe Tan
```  

- use **" "** not "" for one spacing

### Additional Practices  

- Sorting items into lists
```python
foot_bones = ["calcaneus", "talus", "cuboid", "navicular", "lateral cuneiform", 
            "intermediate cuneiform", "medial cuneiform"]
longer_names = []
shorter_names = []
for bone_name in foot_bones:
    if len(bone_name) < 10:
        shorter_names.append(bone_name)
    else:
        longer_names.append(bone_name)
print(shorter_names)
print(longer_names)
```
*Output:*
```
['calcaneus', 'talus', 'cuboid', 'navicular']
['lateral cuneiform', 'intermediate cuneiform', 'medial cuneiform']
```

- Sorting items in lists into strings
```python
foot_bones = ["calcaneus", "talus", "cuboid", "navicular", "lateral cuneiform", 
            "intermediate cuneiform", "medial cuneiform"]
longer_names = ""
shorter_names = ""
for bone_name in foot_bones:
    if len(bone_name) < 10:
        shorter_names += "\n" + bone_name
    else:
        longer_names += "\n" + bone_name
print(shorter_names)
print(longer_names)
```
_Output:_
```
calcaneus
talus
cuboid
navicular
lateral cuneiform
intermediate cuneiform
medial cuneiform
``` 

- Using \n and \t escape characters
```python
print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are! \n\t\tUp above the world so high, \n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky. \nTwinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are!")
```
*Output:*
```
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are! 
		Up above the world so high, 
		Like a diamond in the sky. 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
	How I wonder what you are!
```
