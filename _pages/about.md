Welcome to my programming site. I hope you find the things here informative and useful for your learning or your discovery about my learning process.

## BACKGROUND:  
Hello there! I am Bei Le, an ex-KPMG Senior Auditor with approx. 2.4 years of audit work experience in the Big 4 Accounting Firm (2018-2020).
I am also a Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduate with a bachelors’ degree in Accountancy (2nd upper hons.).

> Before 2021, I largely specialise in finance-related aspects and knowledge / auditing in terms of hard skills, and am proficient in using standard software programmes such as Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook, etc.

> In my audit career in KPMG, I had the opportunity to learn audit softwares like IDEA and eAudit, and I could import, sanitise and transform data as needed into their new data analytics platform, KPMG CLARA.

This year (2021), I am seeking to pivot to the tech/ data analytics field. My endeavours in this journey is detailed below.  


## WHY I LEARN PROGRAMMING:  

### _Creating value & Employability:_  

Digital skills are getting increasingly relevant in today’s world, and knowing about programming languages and how to use them are some of the most sought-after tech skills which employers value and that are essential in problem solving, increasing productivity, creating products and generating solutions.  

When I searched for job opportunities where I could learn new skills to upgrade myself, many job descriptions state a preference for candidates to have aptitudes in various programming languages, especially Python and SQL.  

### _Upskilling myself & Finding purpose:_  

As my course of study and work did not require coding skills and knowledge previously, I felt that I had missed out on learning how to program.  

Being a reflective individual, I was very much self-aware that I should definitely upgrade myself in terms of learning how to code and use the different types of programming languages.  

My favourite subjects in school were Math and Physics. As a highly analytical and detailed individual, I love problem solving.  

The adrenaline and feeling of satisfaction when a program runs correctly without any bugs in the end keeps me motivated to learn. The aha lightbulb moment when I learn how to program more efficiently in a different manner also inspires me to want to learn how to write efficient code.  

These are reasons why I wish to pivot from audit, which is more administrative in nature, into the tech field or doing data analytics, where I can problem solve and create/ build something tangible like an app or website, or provide solutions to business problems by analysing and modelling data sets.  

These give me a higher sense of achievement and fulfilment.  

## MY GOALS:    

I hope that by embarking on this learning journey, I can hone my programming & business skills.  

Eventually, I want to become a more effective problem solver who can create useful algorithms & solutions such as mobile apps, websites and games etc. as I become more proficient and confident in programming.  
I also hope to be able to provide solutions to solve business problems using data analytics and problem solving skills.

### Programming skills I gained in 2021:  
Kindly refer to my blog posts in this site for the detailed programming journey I embarked on this year.  

### Digital & Business skills I gained in 2021:  

**_Jan 2021:_**  
Attended a Scrum course and learnt about Agile methodologies and how Agile helps to create effective teams.  
- Attained the ScrumMaster certification issued by Scrum Alliance.
     - Learnt to apply scrum practices like sprint planning, planning/inserting/shifting tasks in product backlogs, setting definitions of 'done' for tasks, sprint review and sprint retrospectives.  

**_Feb 2021:_**  
I enrolled in a 6-month digital upskilling program called [RISE](https://rise.bcg.com/business-data-analytics/), an initiative by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), in the business and data analytics track, to build my business and digital skills.  
The course is currently ongoing, and is expected to end in early Aug 2021.  
- Gained business skills including creative problem solving, modelling and analysis, story lining and slide writing.  
- Completed a case project and presentation on how to increase Apple's consumer electronics revenues, in a team of 6 members.  
    - Examples of problem solving skills applied includes SCQ (Situation Complication Question) framework, basic data modelling involving use of assumptions and based on relevant historical or projected datasets across the different years (e.g. revenues by products, revenues by country, product price comparisons, technology brand values & more), story lining and slide writing.  

**_Mar 2021:_**  
In RISE by BCG, in the month of Mar 2021:  
- Attained human centred design (HCD) skills involving the 4 main phases of research, synthesise, produce & evaluate.  
- Completed a case project and presentation on how to improve the customer journey for a non tech-savvy Starhub mobile phone and plan customer, in the same team of 6 members.  
    - Examples of the design thinking principles and practices applied during the project include: user interviews, stakeholder journey mapping, persona mapping, Crazy 8s, Creative Matrix, Concept Poster, Evaluation.  
    - Methods used involved Affinity diagramming, DVF Analysis, Impact/Difficulty Analysis, Storyboarding, Wireframing, Product Metrics.  

I also took up a 2-day online course by DigitalBCG Academy, did multiple hands-on PowerBI practices using sample datasets, and also went through another PowerBI course on LinkedIn Learning.  
- Now, I am confident in using PowerBI, a data visualisation tool.  
 
**_Apr 2021:_**  
In RISE by BCG, in the month of Apr 2021:  
- Completed a case project and presentation on how to improve the visitor journey for a family of international travellers seeking to experience fun and exciting activities together in Sentosa when visiting Singapore, in the same team of 6 members.  
    - Examples of the design thinking principles and practices applied during the project include: user interviews, stakeholder journey mapping, persona mapping, Crazy 8s, Creative Matrix, Concept Poster, Evaluation.  
    - Methods used involved Card Sorting, Affinity diagramming, DVF Analysis, Impact/Difficulty Analysis, Storyboarding, Wireframing, Product Metrics.  

        > _As it had been 3 months of working within the same team, we learnt to adapt to one anothers' working styles and contributed to the project in different ways._  
        >
        > _We had contrasting views on ideas at times, but we were able to sound out one anothers' opinions and learn from one another, and agree to go with the majority in case opinions still stood strong._             
        >
        >_We played to our strengths in the project and presentation, as all of us had strengths especially in different areas: - project management and keeping the team on track in terms of goals and timelines; meticulousness and critical thinking/ devil's advocate role; good speaking & answering skills; great design skills; people and network resourcefulness; informational resourcefulness - all these contributed to a great team outcome._
